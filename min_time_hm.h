/*! @file min_time_hm.h
 *! @author Tobias Rolke (github.com/chillerwal/)
 *! @version 1.0
 *! @date 2022-11-18
 *! @brief Only stores hours and minutes in a small memory footprint.
    Can add and substract times with or without rolling over midnight.
    There is also a flag for detected invalid times, when overflow is
    not active.
  
    Made for use with Arduino, no dependencies.
