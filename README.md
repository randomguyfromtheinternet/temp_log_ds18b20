# Temperature Logging for Arduino
Sketch for Arduino Uno (Atmega 328) using DS18B20 temperature sensors. One or more sensors can be attached to the bus. The temperatures from the sensors are polled every minute and logged onto SD card in CSV file format.

## Using
- SD shield with real time clock (RTC)
- one or more DS18B20 sensors on PIN 5
